# Reservoir property estimation based on well log and machine learning

**Background**

The in-situ reservoir parameters are estimated using well logs, which is critical for reservoir modeling, reserve estimation, and production forecasting. Multi-mineral physics or empirical equations are frequently used in modeling. When a sufficient amount of training data is available, a machine learning solution can be used to estimate reservoir parameters based on well log data, with a shorter turn-around time and fewer human interactions.

**Problem Statement**

The purpose of this project is to create data-driven models to estimate reservoir attributes such as shale volume, porosity, and fluid saturation using a standard set of well logs such as gamma ray, bulk density, neutron porosity, resistivity, and acoustic data.

We have log data from 9 wells in the same field, as well as reservoir parameters calculated by petrophysicists. Using the provided training dataset, we must create a data-driven model.

**Targets** are shale volume (VSH), porosity (PHIF), and water saturation (SW)
